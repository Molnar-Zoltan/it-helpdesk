   * Wipes every row in the database and re-inserts the demo fixture, in a
   * single transaction so a caller never observes a half-empty database
   * mid-reset. Full wipe, not a diff against seed state — this project's
   * demo accounts aren't blocked from creating/closing/reopening tickets
   * or posting messages (only the four `/users/me` self-service mutations
   * are), so real accounts and ticket data can also accumulate on the live
   * demo over time; a partial reset would leave those behind.
   *
   * Deletion order respects FK direction (children before parents):
   * Message/RefreshToken both reference User or Ticket, which must go
   * last. AiUsage doesn't need a line here -- Step 10.2 tracks the AI
   * daily limit in Redis, not a Prisma table (see schema.md). seedDemoData
   * (Step 4.1.9's extracted insert logic) then re-creates the same
   * fixture `prisma db seed` does, so a reset produces byte-identical
   * state to a fresh seed.
   *
   * The transaction's timeout is explicitly raised (see
   * admin.constants.ts) rather than left at Prisma's 5s default: this
   * runs on a ~48h cron against a Neon compute that scales to zero when
   * idle, so almost every real invocation pays a cold-start penalty on
   * top of the transaction's own round trips -- the default timeout was
   * hit in production and surfaced as a bare, undiagnosable 500.
